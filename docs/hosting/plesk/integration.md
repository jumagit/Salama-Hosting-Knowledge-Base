# Plesk Hosting Integration Guide

## Content Management System Integration

### WordPress Integration and Optimization
Plesk provides native WordPress integration through the WordPress Toolkit extension, offering centralized management of multiple WordPress installations from a single interface. This toolkit enables one-click installations, automated updates, security hardening, and staging environment creation for WordPress sites.

The integration includes intelligent sync capabilities that allow content synchronization between staging and production environments, enabling safe testing of updates and changes before deployment. WordPress-specific security features include malware scanning, security key rotation, and plugin vulnerability monitoring.

Performance optimization tools within the WordPress integration provide caching configuration, database optimization, and image compression specifically tuned for WordPress environments. These features significantly improve site loading times and reduce server resource consumption.

### Drupal and Joomla Management
Drupal installations benefit from Plesk's application management features including automated core and module updates, database optimization tools, and integrated backup solutions. The platform supports multiple Drupal versions simultaneously, enabling gradual migration paths for complex sites.

Joomla integration provides similar management capabilities with extension management, template customization tools, and security monitoring specifically designed for Joomla's architecture. Multi-site Joomla installations can be managed efficiently through Plesk's centralized interface.

Both platforms integrate with Plesk's staging environment features, allowing administrators to test updates and modifications safely before applying changes to production sites. Version control integration supports collaborative development workflows for custom themes and extensions.
