# Plesk Hosting Troubleshooting Guide

## Control Panel Access Issues

### Login Problems and Authentication Failures
When experiencing login difficulties, first verify that you're using the correct URL format and accessing the control panel through HTTPS on the appropriate port (typically 8443). Browser cache and cookie issues can prevent successful authentication, so clearing browser data often resolves persistent login problems.

Check for typos in username and password entries, ensuring that Caps Lock is disabled and the correct character encoding is used. If password reset attempts fail, contact your hosting provider to verify account status and reset credentials through administrative tools.

Network connectivity issues may prevent access to the control panel, particularly if firewall rules or IP restrictions are configured. Verify that your current IP address is allowed to access the control panel and that no network-level blocking is preventing connection to the server.

### Interface Loading and Performance Issues
Slow control panel performance often indicates server resource constraints or network connectivity problems. Monitor server resource usage through available system tools and identify processes consuming excessive CPU or memory resources.

Browser compatibility issues can cause interface elements to load incorrectly or function improperly. Test control panel access using different browsers and disable browser extensions that might interfere with JavaScript functionality or form submissions.

Clear browser cache and cookies specifically for the control panel domain to resolve persistent interface problems. Outdated cached resources can prevent new features from loading correctly or cause functionality conflicts with updated panel versions.

## Website and Domain Problems

### Site Accessibility and DNS Resolution
When websites become inaccessible, start troubleshooting by verifying DNS resolution using tools like nslookup or dig to confirm that domain names resolve to correct IP addresses. DNS propagation delays can cause temporary accessibility issues after configuration changes.

Check domain expiration status and DNS server configuration to ensure that domains are current and pointing to active nameservers. Expired domains or misconfigured DNS settings are common causes of website unavailability.

Verify that web server services are running and properly configured through the Plesk interface. Apache or Nginx configuration errors can prevent websites from loading, even when DNS resolution works correctly.

### SSL Certificate Problems
SSL certificate errors manifest as browser security warnings and encrypted connection failures. Verify certificate installation and expiration dates through the SSL/TLS Certificates section of the control panel, addressing expired or misconfigured certificates promptly.

Mixed content warnings occur when secure pages load insecure resources, breaking SSL functionality. Review website code and content to ensure all resources (images, scripts, stylesheets) use HTTPS URLs when served over secure connections.

Certificate authority validation failures prevent automatic certificate renewal and installation. Verify domain ownership and ensure that validation files or DNS records are properly configured for certificate authorities to complete verification processes.

### File Permission and Access Issues
File permission problems prevent websites from functioning correctly and can cause security vulnerabilities. Web server processes require specific permission levels to read and execute website files while maintaining security boundaries.

Incorrect ownership settings can prevent web applications from writing files or accessing databases. Verify that file ownership matches the web server user account and that group permissions allow necessary access without exposing sensitive information.

Directory permission problems affect website functionality including file uploads, cache generation, and log file creation. Review application requirements and set permissions appropriately while following security best practices for web server environments.

## Email Service Troubleshooting

### Mail Delivery and Reception Problems
Email delivery issues require systematic diagnosis starting with mail server logs and connection testing. Verify that mail server services are running and accepting connections on standard ports (25, 110, 143, 993, 995).

Check spam filtering settings and quarantine folders when expected emails don't arrive. Overly aggressive filtering can block legitimate messages, while misconfigured whitelist and blacklist settings affect message delivery patterns.

DNS records including MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configurations directly impact email deliverability. Verify that these records are properly configured and propagated to improve message delivery success rates and reduce spam classification.

### Webmail and Client Configuration Issues
Webmail access problems often stem from browser compatibility or session management issues. Clear browser cache and cookies for the webmail interface, and verify that JavaScript is enabled for full functionality.

Email client configuration requires accurate server settings including hostname, port numbers, and authentication methods. Provide users with current configuration information and verify that security settings match server capabilities and requirements.

Connection timeout issues may indicate firewall restrictions or server overload conditions. Monitor server performance and network connectivity to identify bottlenecks affecting email service performance.

## Database Connection and Performance Issues

### Database Service Problems
Database connection failures require verification that database services are running and accepting connections. Check service status through the control panel and restart services if necessary to resolve temporary connection issues.

Authentication problems prevent applications from accessing databases even when services are running. Verify database user credentials, permissions, and host restrictions to ensure applications can establish authorized connections.

Database corruption can cause widespread application failures and data access problems. Regular backups enable recovery from corruption issues, while database repair tools can address minor consistency problems.

### Performance and Resource Constraints
Slow database queries affect overall website performance and user experience. Identify problematic queries through slow query logs and optimize database indexes and table structures to improve performance.

Database resource exhaustion causes connection failures and application timeouts. Monitor database memory usage, connection pools, and storage space to prevent resource-related service interruptions.

Connection pool exhaustion prevents new database connections when applications don't properly release connections. Review application code for connection management best practices and configure appropriate connection limits.

## Security and Malware Issues

### Malware Detection and Removal
Security scans that detect malware require immediate attention to prevent further compromise and protect website visitors. Isolate affected websites and perform comprehensive malware removal using integrated security tools or manual file analysis.

Identify infection vectors including outdated software, weak passwords, or insecure file uploads to prevent reinfection. Update all applications and plugins, change compromised passwords, and review file upload security measures.

Monitor website behavior after malware removal to ensure complete remediation and detect any remaining malicious code. Implement enhanced monitoring to catch future security issues before they affect website operations.

### Suspicious Activity and Intrusion Attempts
Unusual login attempts and suspicious network activity may indicate security compromise or attack attempts. Review access logs and failed login attempts to identify patterns and potential security threats.

Implement IP blocking for persistent attack sources while avoiding blocking legitimate users. Geographic restrictions and rate limiting can reduce automated attack effectiveness without impacting normal website operations.

Security alert fatigue can cause important warnings to be overlooked. Configure alert thresholds and notification preferences to ensure critical security events receive appropriate attention while reducing false alarm frequency.

## Performance Optimization Problems

### Resource Usage and Server Load
High server resource usage affects all hosted websites and services. Identify resource-intensive processes and applications through system monitoring tools, addressing inefficient code and excessive resource consumption.

Memory exhaustion causes service failures and poor performance across the hosting environment. Monitor memory usage patterns and identify memory leaks in applications that consume resources without releasing them properly.

CPU overutilization slows server response times and affects user experience. Profile application performance to identify CPU-intensive operations and optimize code efficiency or redistribute processing load.

### Caching and Content Delivery Issues
Caching configuration problems can degrade performance despite optimization efforts. Verify that caching systems are properly configured and functioning, with appropriate cache invalidation policies for dynamic content.

Content delivery network issues affect global website performance. Monitor CDN status and configuration to ensure proper content distribution and fallback mechanisms when CDN services experience problems.

Static resource optimization including image compression and minification affects page loading times. Implement automated optimization tools and content preprocessing to reduce bandwidth usage and improve user experience.

## Backup and Recovery Challenges

### Backup Failure and Corruption Issues
Failed backup operations compromise data protection and recovery capabilities. Monitor backup job status and error logs to identify and resolve issues preventing successful backup completion.

Backup corruption affects recovery reliability and may indicate underlying storage or system problems. Test backup integrity regularly and maintain multiple backup copies with different retention periods for comprehensive protection.

Storage space limitations prevent backup operations from completing successfully. Monitor backup storage usage and implement retention policies that balance data protection needs with available storage capacity.

### Recovery and Restoration Problems
Incomplete restorations can leave systems in inconsistent states with missing or corrupted data. Verify restoration procedures and test recovery processes regularly to ensure reliable data recovery capabilities.

Permission and ownership issues after restoration can prevent applications from functioning correctly. Review restored file permissions and ownership settings to match original configurations and security requirements.

Database restoration failures affect application functionality and data integrity. Verify database backup formats and compatibility with target systems before attempting restoration procedures during emergency situations.
