**General Questions**

**Q1: What exactly is DirectAdmin?**
**A1:** DirectAdmin is a graphical web-based control panel designed to simplify the management of web hosting. It provides an intuitive interface for users to control their websites, email accounts, databases, files, and server settings without needing to use complex command-line instructions. It's known for being lightweight, efficient, and very stable.

**Q2: Is DirectAdmin free to use?**
**A2:** No, DirectAdmin is a commercial software product and requires a paid license to operate. However, if you purchase a hosting plan from a provider that uses DirectAdmin, the cost of the license is typically bundled into your hosting fee, so you won't pay for it separately.

**Q3: How do I access my DirectAdmin control panel?**
**A3:** Your hosting provider will give you a specific URL, username, and password. The URL usually follows the format `http://yourdomain.com:2222` or `https://yourserverip:2222` (where `2222` is the default DirectAdmin port). Simply enter this URL into your web browser and input your credentials.

**Q4: Can I host multiple websites on one DirectAdmin account?**
**A4:** Yes, absolutely! Depending on your hosting plan's limits, you can easily host multiple websites (referred to as "domains" or "addon domains") within a single DirectAdmin account. You can add new domains via the "Domain Setup" option in the "Account Manager" section.

**Q5: What are the different access levels in DirectAdmin?**
**A5:** DirectAdmin has three primary access levels:
    * **User Level:** For individual website owners to manage their specific hosting account.
    * **Reseller Level:** For users who want to sell hosting services, allowing them to create and manage multiple User accounts.
    * **Administrator Level:** The highest level, for server owners or hosting providers, to manage all aspects of the server, including Reseller and User accounts.

**Website & Domain Management**

**Q6: How do I upload my website files?**
**A6:** You have two primary methods:
    * **File Manager:** Log into DirectAdmin, go to "System Info & Files" > "File Manager," then navigate to your domain's `public_html` folder. You can upload files directly from your browser.
    * **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Use an FTP client (like FileZilla). Find your FTP credentials under "Account Manager" > "FTP Management" in DirectAdmin, then connect and upload files to the `public_html` directory.

**Q7: My website shows an "Internal Server Error" (500 Error). What should I do?**
**A7:** This is often caused by a misconfigured `.htaccess` file or incorrect file permissions.
    * **`.htaccess`:** In your File Manager, rename the `.htaccess` file in your `public_html` directory (e.g., to `htaccess.bak`). If the site loads, the issue is with that file.
    * **Permissions:** Ensure your files have permissions `644` and directories `755`. Use the File Manager to check and correct them.
    * **PHP Errors:** Check your website's error logs (often found in a `logs` folder within your user directory) for specific PHP error messages.

**Q8: How do I install an SSL certificate for my website?**
**A8:** DirectAdmin makes it easy! Go to "Account Manager" > "SSL Certificates." You can usually generate and install a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate automatically, which is highly recommended for all websites to enable HTTPS.

**Q9: How can I change my website's PHP version?**
**A9:** DirectAdmin usually provides a "PHP Selector" or "Select PHP Version" option under "Account Manager" or "Advanced Features." This allows you to choose different PHP versions (e.g., 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2) for your domains to ensure compatibility with your web applications.

**Email & Database Management**

**Q10: How do I create a new email address for my domain?**
**A10:** From the DirectAdmin dashboard, go to "E-mail Management" > "E-mail Accounts." Click on "Create E-mail account," enter the desired username (e.g., `info`), choose a strong password, and set a quota if needed.

**Q11: My emails are not sending/receiving. What could be the issue?**
**A11:**
    * **Credentials/Quota:** Double-check your email account password and ensure the mailbox isn't full via DirectAdmin > "E-mail Accounts."
    * **Client Settings:** Verify your email client (Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.) settings for POP3/IMAP and SMTP servers, ports, and authentication.
    * **DNS MX Records:** Ensure your domain's MX records (managed under "DNS Management") are correctly pointing to your mail server.
    * **Spam Filters:** Check your SpamAssassin settings (under "E-mail Management") to ensure legitimate emails aren't being filtered out.

**Q12: How do I create a database for my WordPress site?**
**A12:** Go to "Account Manager" > "MySQL Management." Click "Create New Database," provide a database name, a database username, and a strong password. **It's crucial to record these credentials** as you'll need them to configure your WordPress `wp-config.php` file.

**Security & Backups**

**Q13: How do I back up my website using DirectAdmin?**
**A13:** DirectAdmin has a built-in backup feature. Go to "Account Manager" > "Create/Restore Backups." You can choose to back up your entire account (files, databases, emails, settings) or select specific components. You can then download the backup file to your local computer.

**Q14: What security features does DirectAdmin offer?**
**A14:** DirectAdmin includes various security tools:
    * **SSL Certificates:** For encrypted website traffic (HTTPS).
    * **IP Blocker:** To block specific IP addresses.
    * **Password Protected Directories:** To secure sensitive web areas.
    * **SpamAssassin:** For email spam filtering.
    * It also integrates well with server-level firewalls like CSF/LFD and comprehensive security suites like Imunify360.

**Performance & Troubleshooting**

**Q15: Why is my website slow?**
**A15:** Common causes include:
    * **High Resource Usage:** Your account might be hitting CPU, RAM, or bandwidth limits. Check "Site Summary / Statistics / Logs" in DirectAdmin.
    * **Unoptimized Website:** Large images, unminified code, or too many plugins can slow down a CMS.
    * **Outdated PHP:** Ensure you're using a recent, supported PHP version via the PHP Selector.
    * **Lack of Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., LiteSpeed Cache, WP Super Cache) if using a CMS.
    * **Server Load:** If shared hosting, other accounts on the same server might be consuming resources.

**Q16: Where can I find my website's error logs?**
**A16:** Error logs are vital for diagnosing issues. You can usually find them in your DirectAdmin **File Manager**:
    * Check within your `public_html` directory.
    * Look for a `logs` folder within your main user directory (`/home/yourusername/logs/`).
    * Access raw logs directly via "Site Summary / Statistics / Logs" in DirectAdmin.

**Q17: My question isn't listed here. How can I get help?**
**A17:**
    * **Review DirectAdmin Documentation:** The official DirectAdmin documentation is extensive.
    * **Contact Your Hosting Provider:** For server-specific issues, account-related problems, or if you require higher-level access, your hosting provider's support team is your primary resource.
    * **DirectAdmin Community Forums:** For general DirectAdmin questions or advice from other users.
