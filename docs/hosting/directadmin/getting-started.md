# DirectAdmin Hosting: Getting Started Guide

Embarking on your web hosting journey with DirectAdmin is a straightforward process, thanks to its intuitive design. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the essential steps to get your DirectAdmin account set up and your first website online.

## Step 1: Accessing Your DirectAdmin Panel

Your hosting provider will furnish you with the necessary credentials to log in to your DirectAdmin control panel.

1.  **Locate Your Login Details:** You should receive an email from your hosting provider containing:
    * Your DirectAdmin URL (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com:2222` or `https://yourserverip:2222`). The port `2222` is the default for DirectAdmin.
    * Your Username
    * Your Password

2.  **Open Your Web Browser:** Enter the provided DirectAdmin URL into your browser's address bar.

3.  **Enter Credentials:** On the DirectAdmin login page, input your username and password, then click "Sign In."

    * **Tip:** If you encounter issues, ensure you're using the correct port and that your internet connection isn't blocking the port.

## Step 2: Familiarizing Yourself with the DirectAdmin Interface

Once logged in, take a moment to explore the DirectAdmin dashboard. You'll notice a clean layout categorized into distinct sections.

* **Main Menu (Left Sidebar or Top Bar):** Provides quick links to major sections like Account Manager, Email Management, File Management, and Advanced Features.
* **Account Statistics:** Often visible on the dashboard, showing your current disk usage, bandwidth, email accounts, databases, etc.
* **User Level / Reseller Level / Admin Level:** At the top right, you'll see your current access level and an option to switch between levels if you have higher permissions.

## Step 3: Setting Up Your First Website (Domain)

If your domain isn't already pre-configured by your hosting provider, you'll need to add it.

1.  **Point Your Domain's DNS:** Before adding your domain to DirectAdmin, ensure its Nameservers are pointed to your hosting server. Your hosting provider will give you these (e.g., `ns1.yourhost.com`, `ns2.yourhost.com`). Update these via your domain registrar (where you purchased the domain). DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate worldwide.

2.  **Add Your Domain in DirectAdmin:**
    * From the main dashboard, navigate to **Account Manager** > **Domain Setup**.
    * Click on **"Add New Domain."**
    * Enter your domain name (e.g., `yourwebsite.com`).
    * Click **"Create."**

    * **Note:** If your domain is already listed here, you can skip this step.

## Step 4: Creating Email Accounts

Professional email addresses (e.g., `yourname@yourdomain.com`) are crucial for businesses.

1.  **Navigate to Email Accounts:** From the dashboard, go to **E-mail Management** > **E-mail Accounts**.
2.  **Create New Account:** Click on **"Create E-mail account."**
3.  **Fill in Details:**
    * **Username:** (e.g., `info`, `support`, `yourname`)
    * **Password:** Choose a strong, unique password.
    * **Quota:** Set a storage limit for the mailbox (e.g., 250MB, or unlimited if allowed by your plan).
4.  **Click "Create."**

You can then configure these email accounts in your preferred email client (Outlook, Gmail, Thunderbird) using the provided POP3/IMAP and SMTP settings, or access them via webmail.

## Step 5: Uploading Your Website Files

This is where your website comes to life!

1.  **Access File Manager:** From the dashboard, go to **System Info & Files** > **File Manager**.
2.  **Navigate to `public_html`:** Double-click on the `domains` folder, then your `yourdomain.com` folder, and finally the `public_html` folder. This is the root directory for your main website.
3.  **Upload Files:**
    * Click the **"Upload Files to current directory"** icon (usually an arrow pointing up).
    * Drag and drop your website files, or click "Select Files" to browse your computer.
    * If you have a compressed archive (ZIP, TAR.GZ), upload it and then use the **"Extract"** option in the File Manager.
    * Ensure your main page (e.g., `index.html`, `index.php`) is directly within the `public_html` directory.

    * **Alternative: Using FTP:** For larger uploads or more control, use an FTP client (like FileZilla).
        * Find your FTP credentials in DirectAdmin under **Account Manager** > **FTP Management**.
        * Connect to your server using the FTP host (your domain or IP), username, and password.
        * Upload your files to the `public_html` directory.

## Step 6: Setting Up a Database (for Dynamic Websites)

If your website uses a CMS (like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal) or another dynamic application, you'll need a database.

1.  **Go to MySQL Databases:** From the dashboard, go to **Account Manager** > **MySQL Management**.
2.  **Create New Database:** Click on **"Create New Database."**
3.  **Enter Details:**
    * **Database Name:** (e.g., `wp_mydb`)
    * **Database User:** (e.g., `wp_myuser`)
    * **Password:** Choose a strong password.
4.  **Click "Create."**
5.  **Record Credentials:** **Crucially, write down or copy the database name, database username, and password.** You'll need these to configure your application (e.g., in `wp-config.php` for WordPress).

## Step 7: Installing Applications (Optional - Recommended for CMS)

DirectAdmin usually comes integrated with one-click installers like Softaculous or Installatron.

1.  **Find the Installer:** Look for "Softaculous Auto Installer," "Installatron," or "Applications Installer" under "Extra Features" or "Advanced Features" in your dashboard.
2.  **Select Your Application:** Browse the list (e.g., WordPress, Joomla, PrestaShop).
3.  **Follow the Installation Wizard:** The installer will guide you through the process, often asking for your domain, database details (which it can create for you), administrator credentials for the application, and site title.

## Step 8: Initial Security Measures

While DirectAdmin is secure, a few steps can enhance your website's safety.

* **Strong Passwords:** Use complex, unique passwords for DirectAdmin, email, FTP, and databases.
* **SSL Certificate:** Install a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate (under "Account Manager" > "SSL Certificates") to enable HTTPS for your domain. This encrypts traffic and improves SEO.
* **Regular Backups:** While your host likely does backups, learn to use DirectAdmin's "Site Backup" feature for additional peace of mind.

By following these steps, you'll have successfully configured your DirectAdmin hosting account and launched your first website. Remember that consistent management and security practices are key to a successful online presence.
