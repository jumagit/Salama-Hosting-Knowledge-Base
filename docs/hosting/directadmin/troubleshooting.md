## 1. Website Not Loading / "Site Can't Be Reached" / "Connection Timed Out"

**Symptoms:** Your website does not display, or your browser shows errors like "This site can't be reached," "Connection timed out," or a blank page.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Check DNS Propagation:**
    * **Purpose:** Ensure your domain name is correctly pointing to your server's IP address and that the changes have taken effect globally.
    * **Method:** Use online DNS lookup tools (e.g., `whatsmydns.net`, `dnschecker.org`) to verify your domain's A record points to your hosting server's IP. DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate fully.
    * **Action:** If DNS is incorrect, update your nameservers or A record at your domain registrar.

2.  **Verify Files in `public_html`:**
    * **Purpose:** Confirm that your website's main index file (e.g., `index.html`, `index.php`, `default.htm`) is correctly uploaded to the `/domains/yourdomain.com/public_html/` directory.
    * **Method:** Log into DirectAdmin, go to **File Manager**, navigate to the `public_html` folder for your domain.
    * **Action:** Upload the missing file or correct its name. Ensure file permissions are generally `644` for files and `755` for directories.

3.  **Check Web Server Status:**
    * **Purpose:** Confirm that the web server (Apache or Nginx) on your server is running.
    * **Method:** (Administrator/Reseller Level) Go to **System Info & Files** > **System Information**. Look for "HTTPD" or "nginx" and check its status. If you are an end-user, contact your hosting provider.
    * **Action:** If stopped, attempt to restart it. If it fails to start, check server logs for errors.

4.  **Firewall Issues:**
    * **Purpose:** A firewall might be blocking incoming connections to port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
    * **Method:** (Administrator Level) Check your server's firewall configuration (e.g., CSF/LFD settings). As an end-user, contact your hosting provider.
    * **Action:** Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open.

5.  **Corrupted `.htaccess` File (Internal Server Error 500):**
    * **Symptoms:** You see a "500 Internal Server Error" message.
    * **Purpose:** A misconfigured `.htaccess` file is a common cause of 500 errors.
    * **Method:** In **File Manager**, navigate to `public_html`. Rename the `.htaccess` file to something like `htaccess.bak`.
    * **Action:** If the site loads, the `.htaccess` file is the culprit. Review its contents for syntax errors or incompatible rules. Restore it piece by piece to identify the problematic line.

## 2. Email Sending/Receiving Problems

**Symptoms:** You can't send or receive emails through your domain, or emails are going to spam.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Verify Email Account Credentials and Quota:**
    * **Purpose:** Ensure your email client settings are correct and the mailbox isn't full.
    * **Method:** Log into DirectAdmin, go to **E-mail Management** > **E-mail Accounts**. Check the password and ensure the quota limit (if set) hasn't been exceeded.
    * **Action:** Reset the password if unsure, and increase the quota if it's full.

2.  **Check Mail Client Settings:**
    * **Purpose:** Confirm your email client (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, etc.) is configured correctly.
    * **Method:** Double-check POP3/IMAP (incoming) and SMTP (outgoing) server names (usually `mail.yourdomain.com`), port numbers (IMAP: 993 SSL/TLS, 143; POP3: 995 SSL/TLS, 110; SMTP: 465 SSL/TLS, 587 STARTTLS, 25), and authentication settings.
    * **Action:** Correct any discrepancies.

3.  **Review Spam Filter Settings:**
    * **Purpose:** Overly aggressive spam filters (SpamAssassin) can block legitimate emails.
    * **Method:** In DirectAdmin, go to **E-mail Management** > **SpamAssassin** (or equivalent). Check your settings, score threshold, and any blacklisted/whitelisted addresses.
    * **Action:** Adjust the score threshold or add sender addresses to the whitelist.

4.  **Check Mail Queue (Admin/Reseller Level):**
    * **Purpose:** See if emails are stuck on the server awaiting delivery.
    * **Method:** (Admin/Reseller) Go to **E-mail Management** > **Mail Queue Administration**.
    * **Action:** Investigate why emails are queued (e.g., recipient server issues, temporary blocks).

5.  **DNS MX Records:**
    * **Purpose:** Ensure your domain's Mail Exchange (MX) records correctly point to your mail server.
    * **Method:** Use an online DNS checker to verify your MX records. They should typically point to `yourdomain.com` or `mail.yourdomain.com` with an appropriate priority.
    * **Action:** If incorrect, update them in DirectAdmin under **Account Manager** > **DNS Management**.

## 3. FTP Connection Problems

**Symptoms:** You cannot connect to your server via FTP, or transfers fail.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Verify FTP Credentials:**
    * **Purpose:** Incorrect username or password.
    * **Method:** Log into DirectAdmin, go to **Account Manager** > **FTP Management**. Confirm the username and password for the FTP account you are using. Remember that the main DirectAdmin username and password can also be used for FTP.
    * **Action:** Re-enter credentials carefully in your FTP client.

2.  **Check Hostname and Port:**
    * **Purpose:** Ensure you're connecting to the correct server address and port.
    * **Method:** FTP Host is usually your domain name or server IP address. Default FTP port is `21`.
    * **Action:** Correct any typos.

3.  **Active vs. Passive Mode:**
    * **Purpose:** Some network configurations or firewalls may interfere with one mode.
    * **Method:** In your FTP client's settings, try switching between "Active" and "Passive" FTP modes. Passive mode is generally more reliable behind firewalls.
    * **Action:** Test connection after changing the mode.

4.  **Local Firewall/Antivirus:**
    * **Purpose:** Your computer's firewall or antivirus software might be blocking the FTP connection.
    * **Method:** Temporarily disable your local firewall/antivirus and try connecting.
    * **Action:** If successful, add an exception for your FTP client or FTP port in your security software.

## 4. Database Connection Errors

**Symptoms:** Your website displays "Error establishing a database connection," "Database connection failed," or similar messages.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Verify Database Credentials:**
    * **Purpose:** The most common cause: incorrect database name, username, or password in your website's configuration file.
    * **Method:** Log into DirectAdmin, go to **Account Manager** > **MySQL Management**. Verify the exact database name, database username, and confirm the password. Then, open your website's configuration file (e.g., `wp-config.php` for WordPress, located in `public_html`) using the File Manager.
    * **Action:** Ensure the credentials in your config file *exactly match* those in DirectAdmin.

2.  **Database Hostname:**
    * **Purpose:** Ensure the database hostname is correct.
    * **Method:** For most DirectAdmin setups, the database hostname is `localhost`. Sometimes it might be the server's IP or a specific database server name.
    * **Action:** Confirm `DB_HOST` is set to `localhost` in your config file unless your host specifies otherwise.

3.  **Database User Permissions:**
    * **Purpose:** The database user might not have sufficient privileges to access the database.
    * **Method:** In DirectAdmin's MySQL Management, click on the database user. Ensure the user is associated with the correct database and has "ALL PRIVILEGES."
    * **Action:** Grant necessary permissions if missing.

4.  **Database Server Status:**
    * **Purpose:** The MySQL/MariaDB server might be down.
    * **Method:** (Admin/Reseller Level) Go to **System Info & Files** > **System Information** and check the status of MySQL/MariaDB. As an end-user, contact your hosting provider.
    * **Action:** If stopped, attempt to restart it. Check MySQL error logs for issues preventing startup.

## 5. Other Common Issues & General Tips

* **"Resource Limit Reached" Errors:**
    * **Symptoms:** Your site goes down intermittently, you receive suspension notices, or see "503 Service Unavailable."
    * **Cause:** You've exceeded your account's allocated resources (CPU, RAM, Entry Processes, Inodes, Bandwidth, Disk Space).
    * **Action:** Check your usage statistics in DirectAdmin. Optimize your website (cache, image optimization, fewer plugins), upgrade your hosting plan, or contact your host.

* **Outdated PHP Version/PHP Errors:**
    * **Symptoms:** Parts of your website break after a script update, or you see PHP error messages.
    * **Cause:** Your PHP version is incompatible with your website's code, or there are syntax errors.
    * **Action:** Use the **PHP Selector** in DirectAdmin (under "Account Manager" or "Advanced Features") to try a different PHP version (usually a newer one). Check your website's error logs (often found in `/home/user/logs/`) for specific PHP error messages.

* **Clear Browser Cache:**
    * **Purpose:** Sometimes, your browser displays an old version of your site or an error page from a previous attempt.
    * **Method:** Clear your browser's cache and cookies, or try accessing your site in an incognito/private window.

* **Check DirectAdmin Logs:**
    * **Purpose:** DirectAdmin itself, and the services it manages, generate logs that can provide crucial information.
    * **Location:**
        * **DirectAdmin Logs:** `/var/log/directadmin/` (access log, error log)
        * **Web Server Logs:** `/var/log/httpd/` (Apache access and error logs) or `/var/log/nginx/`
        * **PHP Logs:** Often within user's `/home/user/logs/` or `/var/log/php-fpm/`
        * **Mail Logs:** `/var/log/exim/` or `/var/log/maillog`
        * **MySQL Logs:** `/var/log/mysqld.log` (Admin access required for most of these).
    * **Action:** Review relevant logs for specific error messages or patterns.

* **Contact Your Hosting Provider:**
    * **When to contact:** If you've exhausted the above steps, suspect a server-wide issue, or require root access to diagnose. Provide them with as much detail as possible about the problem and the steps you've already taken.

By systematically applying these troubleshooting techniques, you can effectively resolve most issues encountered within a DirectAdmin Hosting environment.
