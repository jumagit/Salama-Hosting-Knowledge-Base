## Account and Access

### How do I access my cPanel account?

You can access cPanel through several methods:

1. **Direct URL**: `https://yourdomain.com:2083` or `https://yourserver.com:2083`
2. **Through hosting provider**: Login link in your hosting account dashboard
3. **Alternative ports**: `:2082` (non-SSL) if SSL access isn't working
4. **Server IP access**: `https://server-ip-address:2083` if domain DNS isn't configured

### What should I do if I forget my cPanel password?

1. **Contact your hosting provider** - they can reset your password
2. **Use hosting provider's client portal** - many offer self-service password reset
3. **Check your welcome email** - initial credentials are usually provided there
4. **Use WHM password reset** (if you have WHM access)
5. **Submit support ticket** with proper identity verification

### Can I change my cPanel username?

Generally, **cPanel usernames cannot be changed** after account creation because:
- Username is tied to system-level configurations
- File ownership and permissions are linked to username
- Database and email settings reference the original username

**Alternative solutions:**
- Create a new hosting account with desired username
- Use addon domains for different website identities
- Contact hosting provider for special migration services

### Why can't I access cPanel from certain locations?

Access issues may be due to:

- **Firewall restrictions** at your location blocking cPanel ports (2082, 2083)
- **ISP blocking** of hosting control panel access
- **Geographic restrictions** set by hosting provider
- **Corporate network policies** preventing access to hosting tools
- **Server-side IP blocking** for security reasons

**Solutions:**
- Try accessing from a different network
- Use VPN to change your apparent location
- Contact hosting provider about IP whitelisting
- Try alternative access methods (mobile data, different ISP)

## Email Management

### How many email accounts can I create?

Email account limits depend on your hosting plan:
- **Unlimited plans**: No specific limit on number of accounts
- **Limited plans**: Specific number (e.g., 10, 25, 100 accounts)
- **Storage limits**: Total email storage shared across all accounts
- **Resource constraints**: Too many accounts may impact server performance

**Best practices:**
- Create accounts as needed rather than in bulk
- Set appropriate quotas for each account

## File Management

### What's the difference between public_html and other directories?

**Directory structure explanation:**

- **public_html/**: Your website's public files (visible to visitors)
- **private_html/**: Private files not accessible via web browser
- **mail/**: Email-related files and storage
- **tmp/**: Temporary files (automatically cleaned)
- **logs/**: Server and application log files
- **etc/**: Configuration files
- **ssl/**: SSL certificate storage
- **.trash/**: Deleted files (temporary storage)

**Important notes:**
- Only files in `public_html` are web-accessible
- Never store sensitive data in `public_html`
- Use appropriate permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)

### How do I upload large files to my hosting account?

**File size limitations:**
- **PHP upload limits**: Check `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size`
- **Browser limitations**: Large files may timeout in File Manager
- **Connection stability**: Required for successful large uploads

**Upload methods for large files:**

1. **FTP/SFTP clients**: Best for files over 100MB
2. **Split archives**: Break large files into smaller parts
3. **File Manager**: Use for files under PHP limits
4. **SSH/command line**: Most reliable for very large files
5. **Increase PHP limits**: Contact hosting provider if needed

### What are the correct file permissions for my website?

**Standard permissions:**
- **Files**: 644 (owner read/write, others read-only)
- **Directories**: 755 (owner full access, others read/execute)
- **Configuration files**: 600 or 644 (depending on requirements)
- **Script files**: 755 (if executable)

**Important security notes:**
- **Never use 777** (full permissions for everyone)
- **Avoid 666** for files (world-writable)
