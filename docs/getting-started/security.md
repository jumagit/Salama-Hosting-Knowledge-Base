# Security at Salama Hosting

At Salama Hosting, security is central to our services. We implement robust measures to protect your websites, domains, and email accounts.

## Core Security Measures

### SSL Certificates (HTTPS)
All hosting accounts include free SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt, ensuring encrypted communication between your website and its visitors.
- Automatically installed on most hosting packages
- Premium SSL certificates available for added trust

### Malware Scanning & Threat Detection
We continuously monitor servers for:
- Viruses, malware, and suspicious scripts
- File injection and defacement attacks
- Brute-force login attempts

Suspicious activities are flagged and quarantined, with user notifications as needed.

### Secure Login and Two-Factor Authentication
Access to the Salama Hosting Client Portal is protected by:
- Strong password requirements
- Optional Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Encrypted HTTPS connections

We recommend enabling 2FA for added security.

### Firewalls & Intrusion Prevention
We use hardware and software firewalls, plus intrusion detection systems (IDS), to:
- Block malicious IPs
- Prevent DDoS and brute-force attacks
- Monitor real-time traffic patterns

## Backups & Disaster Recovery
We provide:
- Daily automatic backups on most plans
- 7-day backup retention
- Easy restore via hosting control panel

Enhanced backup options with longer retention and offsite storage are available.

## Server & Account Isolation
Each hosting account is isolated using:
- CageFS (shared hosting): Prevents cross-account access
- PHP version control: Secure PHP versions
- Limited system resource access

This reduces the risk of cross-account compromise.

## Software Patching & Updates
We apply timely security patches to:
- cPanel, Plesk, and DirectAdmin
- Linux operating systems
- Server software (PHP, Apache, MySQL)

Automated alerts ensure prompt updates.

## User Security Best Practices
We recommend:
- Using strong, unique passwords
- Enabling 2FA in the Client Area
- Keeping CMS (e.g., WordPress), plugins, and themes updated
- Avoiding sharing login credentials
- Using SFTP instead of FTP

## Security Compliance
We adhere to:
- GDPR (for EU clients)
- Uganda Data Protection and Privacy Act

Your data is stored securely and never shared without consent.
